          The story follows Ebony, a seventeen-year-old vampire who attends Hogwarts, as she enters a relationship with Draco
          Malfoy. The two are discovered by headmaster Albus Dumbledore, who yells at them and derides them as "motherfukers".
          Ebony later learns that Draco used to date Harry Potter. She becomes so angry at this perceived betrayal that she runs
          into the Forbidden Forest, where Lord Voldemort approaches her. Voldemort gives her a gun and demands that she kill
          Harry, but she refuses. When Draco later learns of this encounter, he is so angry that Ebony keeps it from him that he
          kills himself. In a subsequent scene, however, Harry has a vision of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort, and he
          rescues Draco from Voldemort. Ebony and her friends then attend a My Chemical Romance concert in Hogsmeade. Still, the
          show ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves as Voldemort and his Death Dealers.
          Dumbledore saves Ebony and Draco, and the next day he gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall. During this
          time, Lucian Malfoy and Serious Blak are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting "black guy." There is also a secondary plot
          point in which Professor Trelawney / Professor Sinistra, combined into one character, has an addiction to what is
          presumably the truth serum Veritaserum.
          A third plot point sees Professor McGonagall and Snape attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot
          point follows Remus Lupin and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony. Ebony begins having mysterious visions, about
          which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must travel back in
          "tim" to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's
          addiction. Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself "Satan" and who has been mistakenly
          referred to as "Tom Bombodil," "Tom Anderson," and "Stan." Satan is in a band with James Potter, Severus Snape, Sirius
          Black, and Lucius Malfoy. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is
          further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. Ebony eventually brings Satan forward in time, where he morphs into the
          present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which
          professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between
          Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an Avada Kedavra curse.

          The text above tells the story of "My Immortal", a work of fan fiction published on FanFiction.net under the username
          "XXXbloodyrists666XXX" by an author using the name "Tara Gilesbie". The work was published between early 2006 and 2007,
          ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words. The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note
          explaining that the author was leaving "dubya", commonly believed to be Dubai, and the chapter would be the last until
          the author's return. However, no further chapters were published. It was removed by site administrators in 2008, a few
          months after its last chapter was published. The complete text survives in copied-and-pasted versions across the
          Internet.

          and readers. Christo has provided some evidence to support her claim, but has also been met with skepticism due to the
          many inconsistencies in her story.
