  <h3>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</h3>
    My name is Danny Andreev, I am origionally a physics major and this class will fill my general ed credit requirment for a physics degree from Knox College. I transfered in to washU on a dual degree program to pursue EE at McKelvey. However I dropped out without finishing either in 2018. In 2021 I returned and did a masters in engineering managment, and this year I got started on a Masters in business analytics at the Olin school. I am not sure what year I am but this is my 6th year of higher ed and I have graduate standing </a>
  <h3>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</h3>
  I am a tinkerer at heart, I love learning about all fielding of science and engineering. I dropped out to run a micromobility startup and later worked as a robotics engineer. Last summer I finished a bootcamp in frontend dev. I am looking to finish that physics degree and learn a bit more about design</a>
  <h3>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</h3>
  I learned HTML/CSS/JS + React, Node, SQL, AJAX, postgresql, etc.
  In my capstone project I designed a website that would pull information from a server and compile an interactive tempature graph. Temperature data was gathered by an esp32 microcontroller which would also interface with the server.

  <h3>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h3>
  I would like to learn good UI etiquette
  <h3>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h3>
  The main difference is that screens are interactive and can change sizes somewhat arbitrarely</a>
  <h3>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</h3>
  <a href="https://www.airdna.co/vacation-rental-data/app/us/california/palo-alto/94301/overview">AirDNA</a>
  <br>
  I recently used AirDNA to research a potential property investment and I was really impressed by the ammount of information they were able to neatly pack in while still being very intuitive and friendly.
  <h3>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</h3>
  <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/">McMaster-Carr</a>
  <br>
  hands-down the easiest site to use for finding hardware. I feel like 90% of the reason McMaster-Carr is a sucessful business is because of all the effort that went into creating a catalogue that effectively communicates what they sell.
  <h3>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</h3>
  <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a>
  <br>
  Simple, easy to use, and never breaks. Best navigation & landing page all in one.
